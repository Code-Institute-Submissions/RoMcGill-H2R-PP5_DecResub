## Design

### Colours
<img src="">
The colour and Design of this website was heavily influenced by the controvertial UX/UI design of the Gumroad website, I personally think that this is a great Colour scheme to stand out. the UX is also good as the user scrolls through the alternating rows and coloums Informatioon is displayed clearly and effectively, In this day and age of shopify stores built on templates I belive the end user will welcome this Unique UI as it is fresh new and exciting.

### Fonts
The font used is 'Courier New', Courier, monospace, this font plays the same role as the color scheme as it will be the same for everyone and not suit one brand more than another, some fonts can be too heavy or too light for their intended purpose and give off the wrong tone of a Product or brand, I think the chosen font is a happy medium to suit all brands and products


### Structure
Ease of use was the main goal for this site. and a clear path for both Buyers and Sellers to achieve their goals. I achieved this buy adding large text and icons to describe the use cases for the site.
