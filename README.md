## About
### Home To Retail is designed to maximise sales for small bussinesses and Provide quality products for big retailers.
#### Why?
DIY'rs, Crafters, Painters, Artists Always have trouble when it comes to maximising Sales and revenue due to Not taking advantage of B2B (business to businees) Sales, This could be for a number of reasons. The main two are not taking advantage of technology arround them such as shopify and wixx this is down to the High barrier to entry when creating, maintaining and running your own website on one of theese platforms. the Next reason is just not knowing where to start and who to contact. We have solved both of these Issues.
#### How?
We have solved these issues Firstly by making it easyer than ever to set up your online store front and start selling.We do this by giving our users a simple form and image field to fill out, Once complete our site will automatically build your store front and be available on our site for everyone to see, adding products to your store is done the same way, and will display and be available to purchase in your store. Secondly We will find your Wholesale customers ready to make big orders to stock their shelfs, We do this by giving Wholesalers an easy place to go and purchase products in bulk Hassle free.
## (TO DO) our two way email system means that when your product gets purchased, the buyer will recieve an email to confirm and so will the seller.


## Project Goals
My Goal for this project is to create something scaleable that benifits everyone involved.



## key functions of H2R:
- effortless online storfront building
- effortless bulk buying of unique and bespoke goods

## Design

## Colours
<img src="">
The colour scheme was chosen Deliberatly It is shates of black white and grey with some hints of Opaque Pink, this is to keep the site looking clean, and staright forward, the second reason of why this coulor scheme is integral to the site is that It will not Interfear or clash with any of the brands Coulor schemes or photos, this will give every seller on our platform an equal opportumity to shine through and not force creators or artists to compromise their creativity to fit in with the format or colour scheme of our website to maximise clicks.

## Fonts
The font used is 'Courier New', Courier, monospace, this font plays the same role as the color scheme as it will be the same for everyone and not suit one brand more than another, some fonts can be too heavy or too light for their intended purpose and give off the wrong tone of a Product or brand, I think the chosen font is a happy medium to suit all brands and products


## Structure
Ease of use was the main goal for this site. I also wanted to have a unique user experience that is diffrent and exciting but still familiar, therfore i decided to have my Nav bar on the left hand side of the page, this does not hinder the UX in anyway but adds that little something special to the UI which I think the creative Users of the site will appreciate.

### Website pages
